﻿Dynamic Security Monitor (v1.0)
Project Overview
Dynamic Security Monitor is a comprehensive system hardening and monitoring utility for the Windows operating system, developed in C# using Windows Forms. This tool provides real-time security status monitoring, on-demand vulnerability scanning, and active system management capabilities through a clean, modern, multi-tabbed interface.
The project was developed to provide system administrators, IT professionals, and security-conscious users with a centralized dashboard to proactively identify, analyze, and remediate common security misconfigurations and threats.

Key Features
The tool is organized into a five-tab layout for clear and intuitive navigation:

1. System Status Dashboard
    A live dashboard that continuously monitors critical system settings and provides at-a-glance status using color-coded cards.

    Windows Firewall: Monitors Public, Private, and Domain profiles.

    Antivirus: Checks for an active and running AV solution via WMI.

    User Account Control (UAC): Ensures UAC is enabled and not set to an insecure "auto-approve" level.

    Data Execution Prevention (DEP): Reports the active DEP policy.

Live Notifications: Triggers desktop alerts if a monitored setting becomes insecure.

2. Vulnerability Scanners
Contains tools for finding common privilege escalation vectors.

Unquoted Service Path Scanner: Detects and provides a one-click fix for services with unquoted executable paths.

3. Startup Manager
A powerful utility to inspect and manage programs that launch automatically on system boot.

Comprehensive Scan: Scans all common registry keys and startup folders for both the current user and all users.

Disable Functionality: Allows users to select and permanently disable unwanted or suspicious startup items.

4. Virus & Threat Scan
Provides an interface for on-demand threat scanning.

Windows Defender Integration: Launches a silent "Quick Scan" using the built-in Windows Defender command-line tool.

Progress Feedback: Displays the scan status to the user.

5. Windows Update & Version
Offers tools to analyze the system's patch level and version.

Accurate OS Versioning: Uses the systeminfo command and WMI to get the correct OS name, build number, and patch history.

Patch Recency Analysis: Analyzes the install dates of security hotfixes to determine if the system is actively patched.

Update Check & Install: Checks for new available updates via the Windows Update Agent API and provides a button to open the Windows Update settings page.
